# Project Test And Report

Use this skill before final delivery.

## Workflow

1. Identify changed areas and their risk level.
2. Run the lowest-cost meaningful automated checks.
3. If runtime verification depends on local tools or external environments, state the exact manual verification path.
4. Summarize results in Chinese.

## Suggested Check

Run: `__TEST_COMMAND__`

## Report Format

- `测试范围`
- `执行命令`
- `结果说明`
- `未覆盖项`
- `剩余风险`
